# Dimension

Dimension is a mixed reality installation project by Amy Cooke, Roarna Knowler & Neo Te Aika.
This is a repo of the Unity prototype I built for our project proposal, focused on exploring a stencil method wielded to allow for a "looking glass effect", where headset users would be able to circumnavigate a scale pyramid with different microterrain from each side, being able to walk within and get up close from any side they enter.

An *.APK is attached to the releases tab. This is a general Android package but was developed specifically for Meta Quest 2.
